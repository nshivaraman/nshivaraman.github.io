<h2>Calculating Pressure Loss due to Flow in a Pipe</h2>
<ul>
<li>The diameter of the pipe is D [m]</li>
<li>The length of the pipe is L [m]</li>
<li>The roughness of the pipe is ε [m]</li>
<li>The flow is Q [m<sup>3</sup>/s]</li>
<li>The density is ρ [kg/m<sup>3</sup>]</li>
<li>The kinematic viscosity is η [m<sup>2</sup>/s]</li>
<li>The fluid velocity is v = 4Q/(πD<sup>2</sup>) [m/s]</li>
<li>The Reynolds number is Re = vD/η [1]</li>
<li>The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (1845) is given by the Colebrook-White implicit equation (1939) who developed the equation after experiments by Nikuradse (1933).</li>
<li>An accurate, simplified, explicit approximation of the Colebrook-White equation is the Haaland equation (1983): f=-1.8 log<sub>10</sub>((ε/(3.7D)<sup>1.11</sup>+6.9/Re)))<sup>(-2)</sup> [1]</li>
<li>The resistance coefficient of the pipe is k = fL/D [1]</li>
<li>The Pressure loss is P = kρv<sup>2</sup>/2 [Pa]</li>
