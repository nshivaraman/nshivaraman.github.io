<h2>Calculating Pressure Loss due to Flow in a Pipe</h2>
<p>The diameter of the pipe is D [m]</p>
<p>The length of the pipe is L [m]</p>
<p>The roughness of the pipe is ε [m]</p>
<p>The flow is Q [m^3/s]</p>
<p>The kinematic viscosity is η [m^2/s]</p>
<p>The fluid velocity is v = 4Q/(πD^2) [m/s]</p>
<p>The Reynolds number is Re = vD/η [1]</p>
<p>The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (1845) is given by the Colebrook-White implicit equation (1939) who developed the equation after experiments by Nikuradse (1933).</p>
<p>An accurate, simplified, explicit approximation of the Colebrook-White equation is the Haaland equation (1983): f=-1.8 log10 ((ε/(3.7D)^1.11+6.9/Re)))^(-2) [1]</p>
<p>The resistance coefficient of the pipe is k = fL/D [1]</p>
<p>The Pressure loss is P = kρv^2/2 [Pa]</p>
