<h1>Calculating pressure loss due to flow in a pipe</h1>
<p>The flow is Q</p>
<p>The kinematic viscosity is η</p>
<p>The pipe velocity is v = 4Q/(πD^2)</p>
<p>The Reynolds number is Re = vD/η</p>
<p>The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is given by the Colebrook-White implicit equation (1939)</p>
<p>An accurate, explicit approximation of the Colebrook-White equation is the Haaland equation (1983): f=(-1.8 log10 ((ε/(3.7D)^1.11+6.9/Re)))^(-2)</p>
<p>The resistance coefficient of the pipe is k = fL/D</p>
<p>The Pressure loss is P = kρv^2/2</p>
